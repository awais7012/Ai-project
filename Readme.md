**# Preprocessed Data for C++ AI Model Training**

This repository contains **JSONL** files with preprocessed data for training an AI model on **C++ code**. The dataset is structured into three parts:

- **`train.jsonl`** - Training dataset
- **`test.jsonl`** - Testing dataset
- **`valid.jsonl`** - Validation dataset

Each **JSONL** file consists of multiple JSON objects, where each object represents a piece of **C++ code** along with its associated metadata.

## **Data Structure**

Each entry in the JSONL files follows this structure:

```json
{
  "id": "unique_identifier",
  "code": "C++ source code snippet",
  "tokens": ["tokenized", "representation", "of", "code"],
  "label": "optional label or category",
  "metadata": {
    "source": "dataset source",
    "author": "optional author information"
  }
}
```

## **Usage**

To use this dataset for AI model training:

1. **Load the JSONL files** in your Python script using `jsonlines`:

   ```python
   import jsonlines

   with jsonlines.open('train.jsonl') as reader:
       for obj in reader:
           print(obj)
   ```

2. **Use this data** to fine-tune your AI model.
